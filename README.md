# 86400

What if you had a bank account that credited you Â£86,400 every day? Would you waste it? Would you spend it all? Time is the greatest commodity, and waits for no man. The value of time: we have 86400 seconds in a day. Most people spend over 25,000 seconds sleeping!! 31,536,000 seconds in a year!

This app is very simple but shows you how valueable our time is. I hope to expand this going forward into the future.
